Hello there, I'm Jack! I'm a high school student with a passion for all things tech!

My favorite things to research are:

- OSINT Techiques 

- Social Engineering

- Cybersecurity in General!


I'm a complete beginner at all things cybersecurity, and after working through challenges and learning new things, I've been inspired to start documenting my progress so I can gain a better understanding of the topics I research.
